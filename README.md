# 📖 BotMD – AI-Powered Medical Assistant

BotMD is an **AI-powered chatbot** that supports two modes:

- 🧪 **Prediction Mode** – Users enter their symptoms in natural language.
    
    - Symptoms are extracted using an **LLM**.
        
    - A trained **ML model** (Random Forest / XGBoost) predicts possible diseases.
        
    - A separate LLM step generates a **humanized medical response**.
        
    - Predictions are cached in **Redis** for fast repeated queries.
        
- 💬 **Chat Mode** – Users can ask **general health-related questions**, answered by the LLM with an empathetic disclaimer.
    

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: BotMD is **not a substitute for professional medical advice**. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for medical concerns.
